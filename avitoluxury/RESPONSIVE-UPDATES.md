# Responsive Design Implementation

This document outlines the responsive design improvements implemented across the e-commerce website to ensure a consistent and premium experience across all device sizes.

## Breakpoints Used

We've implemented a mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS's responsive breakpoints:

- `xs`: 375px (small mobile)
- `sm`: 640px (large mobile/small tablet)
- `md`: 768px (tablet)
- `lg`: 1024px (desktop)
- `xl`: 1280px (large desktop)
- `2xl`: 1536px (extra large desktop)

## Key Components Updated

### 1. Product Grid

- Changed grid layout to be properly responsive:
  - 1 product per row on mobile screens
  - 2 products per row on tablet screens
  - 4 products per row on desktop screens
- Adjusted gap spacing between products to be proportional to screen size

```jsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4 xs:gap-6 md:gap-8">
```
