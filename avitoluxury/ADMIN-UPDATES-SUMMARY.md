# E-commerce Perfume Website Updates Summary

## Database Integration

We've updated the project to use MongoDB for all data storage, removing mock/demo data and ensuring proper database integration:

1. **Database Models**:
   - User model for authentication and user data
   - Product model for perfume products
   - Order model for customer orders
   - Wishlist model for user favorites
   - Cart model for shopping carts
   - Contact model for customer inquiries

2. **Authentication System**:
   - JWT-based authentication for both users and admins
   - Secure password hashing with bcrypt
   - Token verification for protected routes

3. **Database Seeding**:
   - Created a seed script (`scripts/seed-database.js`) to initialize the database
   - Added default admin and user accounts
   - Added sample products, orders, and wishlist items

4. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Added script to generate `.env.local` file
   - Structured environment variables for MongoDB, JWT, and external services

## Removed Mock Data

Mock data has been removed from the following components:

1. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Now fetches real-time data from MongoDB
   - Displays actual product, user, and order counts
   - Shows real recent orders

2. **Admin Products Page**:
   - Lists actual products from the database
   - Supports filtering, searching, and pagination
   - Enables CRUD operations on products

3. **Store Pages**:
   - Homepage now displays real featured products, new arrivals, and bestsellers
   - Product details come from the database
   - User interactions (wishlist, cart) are stored in MongoDB

## API Routes

Updated API routes to interact with MongoDB:

1. **Admin API**:
   - `/api/admin/dashboard` - Fetches dashboard statistics
   - Product management endpoints
   - Order management endpoints

2. **User API**:
   - Authentication endpoints
   - User profile management
   - Wishlist and cart operations

3. **Store API**:
   - Product listing and filtering
   - Order processing
   - Contact form submission
