# Security Improvements

This document outlines the security improvements made to the e-commerce application to prevent data leakage and enhance overall security.

## 1. Removed Sensitive Data from Console Logs

- Removed all `console.log` statements that were leaking sensitive information
- Created a secure logging utility (`src/app/lib/secure-logger.ts`) that:
  - Only logs in development environment
  - Completely silent in production
  - Provides different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Updated API routes to use the secure logging utility

## 2. Enhanced Content Security Policy (CSP)

- Implemented a comprehensive Content Security Policy in the middleware
- Added CSP report endpoint to track violations (`src/app/api/csp-report/route.ts`)
- Restricted script sources to prevent malicious code execution
- Limited connect-src to only allow connections to trusted domains
- Configured frame-src to only allow trusted sources for iframes

## 3. Protected Authentication System

- Improved HTTP-only cookie implementation for authentication tokens
- Removed wishlist button for non-logged in users to prevent authentication bypass
- Fixed login redirection to properly handle the redirect path
- Enhanced token validation in middleware

## 4. Removed Hardcoded Secrets

- Removed sensitive information from `next.config.js`:
  - API keys
  - Database credentials
  - JWT secrets
  - SMS service credentials
  - Payment gateway credentials
- Set up environment variables to be loaded from `.env.local` instead of being hardcoded

## 5. Improved Error Handling

- Implemented silent error handling for security-sensitive operations
- Prevented leaking of error details in production environment

## 6. Enhanced Middleware Security

- Added security headers to all responses:
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
  - Permissions-Policy: limiting browser features
  - Strict-Transport-Security: enforcing HTTPS

## 7. Access Control Improvements

- Properly implemented protected routes in middleware
- Fixed authentication state management to prevent unauthorized access
- Made cart accessible to both logged in and non-logged in users
- Restricted wishlist functionality to authenticated users only

## Best Practices for Ongoing Security

1. **Regular Security Audits**: Periodically review code for security vulnerabilities
2. **Update Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies up to date to patch security vulnerabilities
3. **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files to version control
4. **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for CSP violations and other security events
5. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for sensitive endpoints to prevent brute force attacks
6. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input
7. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
8. **Security Headers**: Maintain and update security headers as best practices evolve
